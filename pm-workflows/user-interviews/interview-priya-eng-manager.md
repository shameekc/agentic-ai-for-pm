**[0:00]** Started 2 min late, Priya joined from what looks like a busy open-plan office. Lots of background noise.

**James:** So tell me about how you found NovaByte initially?

**Priya:** Yeah so we were actually evaluating Linear — we used it for like 3 months on a trial internally. It's nice, clean, very dev-focused. But our product team kept saying it was too engineering-centric, they couldn't get the views they needed. So I googled around, someone on Twitter mentioned NovaByte and I signed up basically on a whim.

**[1:45]** She's clearly done her homework, knows the product well for day 7.

**Priya:** "The Jira integration was honestly the thing that sold me. We have like 2 years of history in Jira and I was dreading the migration but it just... pulled everything over. The mapping wasn't perfect but it was like 85% there which is way better than I expected."

**James:** What wasn't perfect about the migration?

**Priya:** Um, custom fields didn't all come through. We have these like, compliance-related fields — fintech stuff you know — and those got dropped. Had to re-add them manually which was annoying but not a dealbreaker.

**[3:30]** [She showed me her screen — has 4 active projects, decent structure. She clearly set things up methodically]

**Priya:** The analytics are honestly really good. Like really good. I can see velocity per sprint, I can see who's blocked, the burndown charts actually update in real time which sounds basic but Linear didn't do that well. "I showed the analytics dashboard to my CEO and he was like, finally I can see what engineering is actually doing."

**James:** Ha, that's great. So what's not working?

**Priya:** Pricing. [long pause] Look, we're 35 people. I've got 6 on the platform now and I want to bring on maybe 15 total — eng plus product plus design. At $18/seat/month that's... hold on... $270/month? $3,240 a year? For a startup that's still pre-Series B that's a real conversation.

**James:** How does that compare to what you were paying for Linear?

**Priya:** Linear was $8/seat. So literally half. And Jira was like $7 or something. I know NovaByte does more but it's hard to justify to finance when they just see the per-seat number, you know?

**[6:20]** She seems genuinely torn. Likes the product but the pricing math doesn't work easily for her.

**Priya:** "If there was a startup tier or something, like under-50-employees discount, I'd convert today. Literally today."

**James:** Noted. What about the rest of your team, how are they finding it?

**Priya:** Mixed honestly. The devs love it, especially the GitHub integration — PRs link to tasks automatically which is chef's kiss. The PM is still getting used to the views. She keeps asking about a Gantt chart which I don't think you have?

**James:** We have a timeline view that's—

**Priya:** Yeah she found that, she says it's not quite the same. [shrugs] PMs, right?

**[8:15]** [She mentioned wanting to see a roadmap view too. Made a note.]

**Priya:** Oh also — any plans for a Slack integration? We basically live in Slack and right now there's no way to get notifications there. I know there's email notifs but nobody reads those.

**James:** It's on the roadmap actually—

**Priya:** "Everyone says that." [laughs] No offense. But yeah that would be huge for us.

**[9:40]** Wrapping up. She asked about annual billing — said if there's a discount for annual she'd be more likely to get budget approval.

**Priya:** One more thing — your onboarding emails are way too many. I got like 6 in the first 3 days. I almost marked them as spam honestly. Just... less is more there.

**[10:30]** End.

**Post-interview notes:**
- Strong potential convert if pricing works out
- Jira migration + analytics = key value props for her
- Linear was the main comparison, lost on price but won on features
- Slack integration is a gap she cares about
- Startup/small-team pricing tier could unlock this segment
- Very articulate, could be a good case study candidate if she converts
