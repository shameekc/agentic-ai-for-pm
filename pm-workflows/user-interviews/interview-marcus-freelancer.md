**[0:00]** Marcus joined from his home office. Very casual, had a coffee. Seemed a bit sheepish about low usage.

**James:** Thanks for hopping on Marcus. So you signed up about 10 days ago — how's it going with NovaByte?

**Marcus:** Uh, honestly? Not great. I mean the product is fine, it's clearly well-built, but um... I think it's just not for me? Like I'm one person. I do contract React work, usually 2-3 clients at a time, and I just need something to track my tasks. NovaByte feels like it was built for a team of 50, not a team of 1.

**[1:20]** [He's not wrong. Our solo user retention is abysmal — 8% last I checked]

**James:** What specifically felt like too much?

**Marcus:** Like when I created a project it asked me about sprints and workflows and team roles and I'm like... it's just me? I just want a list of things to do. I tried to set up a simple kanban board and it took me like 10 minutes because there were all these options for automation rules and approval flows and stuff I'll never use.

**Marcus:** "I felt like I was configuring an aircraft carrier when I just needed a kayak."

**James:** [laughs] That's a good way to put it. What were you using before?

**Marcus:** Todoist. And honestly I'll probably go back to it. It's like $4/month and it does exactly what I need. I also looked at Trello but Todoist just fits my brain better.

**[3:00]** He showed me his one project — literally 6 tasks in it, no due dates, no labels. Very bare bones.

**James:** Was there anything that caught your eye or that you liked?

**Marcus:** The UI is beautiful. Like genuinely. Way better looking than Jira or any of the enterprise-y tools I've had to use on client projects. And uh... the GitHub integration thing looked cool but I didn't set it up because it seemed like more overhead for one person.

**James:** What would have made you stick around?

**Marcus:** Honestly? A simple mode. Like if there was a "solo" or "personal" plan that stripped out all the team stuff and just gave me task management + maybe time tracking, I'd consider it. But at $18/month for what I'd actually use... Todoist is $4.

**[5:15]** [Pricing came up again unprompted. He's clearly price-sensitive as a freelancer]

**Marcus:** "I don't need analytics dashboards or sprint velocity charts when it's literally just me forgetting to update a task."

**James:** Fair enough. Would you use a free tier if we had one?

**Marcus:** Maybe? Like if it was actually free and had basic kanban or list view, I might use it for the occasional bigger project. I had a client last month who wanted shared visibility into my tasks and something like NovaByte would've been useful for that. But I'm not paying $18/month for something I'd use once a quarter.

**[7:00]** He mentioned he found us through a Product Hunt post. Signed up impulsively.

**Marcus:** Oh one thing — your signup flow asks for company name and team size and all that. When I put "1" for team size it still showed me all the team features. Maybe like... detect that and give a simpler onboarding? I dunno.

**James:** That's really good feedback actually.

**Marcus:** Also the trial emails kept talking about "invite your team" and "set up your first sprint" and I was like... none of this applies to me. Felt like the product was telling me I'm not the target customer, haha.

**[8:45]** [He's friendly about it but it's clear we lost him on day 1 basically. The 3 logins were probably: day 1 signup, day 2 poking around, day 8 because we sent a "we miss you" email]

**Marcus:** No hard feelings though. It's a good product for teams. Just not for me.

**[9:30]** End.

**Post-interview notes:**
- Classic wrong-persona acquisition. Solo freelancer, need is too simple
- Product complexity is a barrier — no "simple mode" or lite experience
- Pricing is way off for this segment ($18 vs $4 Todoist)
- Could explore: free tier with 1-user limit? Personal plan?
- Onboarding doesn't adapt to solo users — missed opportunity
- PH acquisition channel may be bringing wrong audience
- The "kayak vs aircraft carrier" quote is gold, should share with design team
