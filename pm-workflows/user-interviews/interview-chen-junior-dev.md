**[0:00]** Chen joined from what looks like a corporate office — badge on lanyard visible. Seemed a bit nervous. Younger guy, maybe 24-25.

**James:** Hey Chen, thanks for taking the time. Tell me a bit about how you started using NovaByte.

**Chen:** Yeah so um, I should probably be upfront — I'm not like a decision maker or anything. I'm a junior dev. I've been at Stratford for about 8 months. We use Jira, obviously, everyone uses Jira [laughs nervously], and I just... I hate it. I saw NovaByte on a YouTube video, one of those dev productivity channels, and I signed up to try it on my own.

**James:** Does your manager know you're evaluating it?

**Chen:** Uh, no. [laughs] Not exactly. I mean I used my personal email. I just wanted to see what else was out there. My plan was like, if it's really good, maybe I'd mention it to my manager and she could look at it? But I don't have any authority to buy anything. At Stratford everything goes through procurement and IT and it's like a whole... thing.

**[1:30]** [Bottom-up discovery. No buying authority. Classic enterprise shadow IT pattern.]

**James:** Totally fine. So what's your impression so far?

**Chen:** "It's SO much better than Jira. Like, night and day." The interface is actually modern, things load fast, I can find stuff. In Jira I spend half my time trying to find the right board or figure out which filter to use. NovaByte just... makes sense?

**James:** What have you tried so far?

**Chen:** I created a couple test projects, just dummy data to play around. I tried the kanban board, the sprint view, um... the workflow builder which is really cool. I also looked at the GitHub integration page but didn't set it up because I obviously can't connect our company GitHub.

**[3:00]** He was exploring more features than I expected for a junior dev with no real use case yet.

**Chen:** Oh and the keyboard shortcuts are amazing. I'm a vim user so I appreciate when tools have good keyboard nav. Is there a full list of shortcuts somewhere? I found some but I feel like there are more.

**James:** Yeah we have a shortcuts reference— I'll send you the link.

**Chen:** The other thing I really liked is the analytics stuff. We don't get any visibility into sprint metrics in Jira. Like, my manager talks about velocity but nobody actually looks at a chart. In NovaByte it's just... there. It's really clean.

**[4:30]** [Interesting that even a junior dev notices the analytics. That's a good sign for the feature's discoverability.]

**James:** So thinking realistically, what would it take for Stratford to adopt something like NovaByte?

**Chen:** [exhales] A lot. So like... Stratford is very enterprise. Everything has to go through vendor approval. There's a security review, I think they check SOC 2, penetration testing reports, um... we're ISO 27001 certified so they'd want NovaByte to be too probably? And then there's the procurement process itself which takes like 3 months minimum.

**[5:30]** Chen started counting on his fingers.

**Chen:** You'd need SSO because we're on Azure AD. SCIM probably. And like enterprise-level support, not just email. My manager's manager is the one who'd have to sign off and he's very um... conservative about new tools. "He still thinks Jira is fine because 'everyone uses it.' That's literally his argument. 'Everyone uses it, Chen.'"

**James:** That's a common sentiment. What would change his mind?

**Chen:** Honestly? If a senior leader pushed for it. Or if NovaByte had some kind of enterprise pilot program where you could test it with one team without going through full procurement. Like a sandbox thing. Because the problem is I can't show the value if I can't get anyone to try it.

**[7:15]** He got more animated here, clearly frustrated by the internal politics.

**Chen:** At my last company — I was at a smaller shop, like 50 people — we could just try tools. Someone would say "hey let's try this" and we'd try it. At Stratford everything is a 6-month evaluation. It's exhausting.

**James:** Would it help if we had enterprise-specific resources? Like a security whitepaper or—

**Chen:** "Yes! Give me something I can forward to my manager that looks official and enterprise-y. If I just say 'hey I found this cool tool' she'll ignore it. If I send her a PDF with logos and compliance certifications she might actually look at it."

**[8:45]** He asked about pricing briefly.

**Chen:** I don't even know what the budget would be. We have like 300 people in engineering globally. At $18/seat that's... uh... $5,400/month? $64,000 a year? Actually maybe that's comparable to what Atlassian charges us. I honestly have no idea what we pay for Jira.

**James:** Enterprise pricing is usually custom—

**Chen:** Yeah I figured. Anyway I'll probably keep playing with it during the trial. Maybe I'll work up the courage to show my manager. "Worst case I just found a tool I like that I can never use at work." [laughs sadly]

**[10:00]** End.

**Post-interview notes:**
- Zero buying authority but genuine enthusiasm — bottom-up advocate
- Enterprise procurement at Stratford is 3-6 months minimum
- Needs: SSO (Azure AD), SCIM, ISO 27001, enterprise support
- Potential 300-seat deal but very long sales cycle
- Wants "enterprise-y" resources to share internally — sales enablement gap
- Good product feedback: loves UI, keyboard shortcuts, analytics
- Shadow IT pattern — using personal email, manager doesn't know
- Consider: enterprise pilot/sandbox program for bottom-up adoption?
- Follow-up: send enterprise security overview PDF when ready
- Low probability of near-term conversion but signals enterprise demand
