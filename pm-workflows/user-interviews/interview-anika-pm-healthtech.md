**[0:00]** Anika was working from home, had a kid briefly wander into frame at the start. Apologized, seemed a bit frazzled but friendly.

**Anika:** Sorry about that — working from home Fridays, you know how it is. OK so NovaByte. Yeah I've been poking around for about a week.

**James:** What brought you to NovaByte?

**Anika:** So we're a healthtech company, about 200 people, my team is 15 — mix of devs, designers, and QA. We've been using Monday.com for like a year and it's... fine? It does the job. But it's gotten really expensive and honestly the interface is cluttered. Every time Monday ships a new feature they just bolt it on and the UI gets more confusing.

**Anika:** "Monday.com feels like a tool designed by people who never have to actually use it every day."

**[1:30]** She pulled up both tools side by side to show me.

**Anika:** See this? Monday has like 47 columns on this board. We use maybe 8 of them. But I can't hide them without affecting everyone else's view, or I have to create a new view, and then there are too many views, and... [waves hand] it's a mess.

**James:** How does NovaByte compare so far?

**Anika:** Cleaner. Way cleaner. The workflow templates were actually what got me excited. We do regulated software — FDA-adjacent stuff, not medical devices but health data — and your "Regulated Development" template was shockingly close to our actual process. I just had to tweak a few stages and it was like 90% there.

**[3:00]** [Good signal — the templates are landing well with regulated-industry users]

**Anika:** I've got 4 of my team members in there now and feedback has been mostly positive. The task creation flow is intuitive, the board view is fast, um... my lead dev likes the sprint planning view.

**James:** What's the "mostly" part — what's not positive?

**Anika:** Slack. We need Slack integration badly. Like, our whole team communication runs through Slack. We have a channel for each project and right now I'm manually copying NovaByte updates into Slack which is... not sustainable. Monday at least has a decent Slack integration — it sends notifications for status changes, you can create tasks from Slack, all that.

**[4:30]** [Third or fourth time Slack has come up across interviews. This is a real gap.]

**Anika:** "If NovaByte had Slack integration at the level Monday.com has, I'd switch tomorrow. That's not an exaggeration."

**James:** It's actively being built—

**Anika:** When? Like Q1? Q2? Because my trial ends in 6 days and I need to make a decision.

**James:** I can check on the exact timeline—

**Anika:** Please do. That's honestly the #1 blocker for me. My team will revolt if they lose Slack notifications.

**[5:45]** She shifted to talking about her evaluation criteria.

**Anika:** So I'm comparing NovaByte, staying on Monday, and also looking briefly at Asana. Asana's nice but expensive for what you get. NovaByte pricing — $18/seat for 15 people is $270/month. Monday is charging us $300 right now so it's actually slightly cheaper, which is good.

**James:** How important is pricing in this decision?

**Anika:** It's a factor but not the main one. We have budget. For me it's: does the tool help my team ship faster and does it integrate with our stack? We use Slack, GitHub, Figma, and Confluence mainly. NovaByte has GitHub which is great. No Slack which is bad. No Figma or Confluence which is... eh, nice-to-have.

**[7:00]** I asked about the healthtech/compliance angle.

**Anika:** Oh yeah, so we're not as intense as like a hospital system but we do handle health data. We'd need to see SOC 2 at minimum. Our CISO would probably ask about data residency too. We went through this with Monday and it took about a month to get all the paperwork sorted.

**Anika:** Actually that reminds me — your audit log, where is it? I was looking for a way to see who changed what and when, especially for workflow changes. In regulated environments we need to demonstrate traceability. I found some activity feed thing but it didn't seem comprehensive enough.

**[8:30]** [Audit trail depth came up with Sarah too. Enterprise/regulated users need more here.]

**James:** What would make this a clear yes for you?

**Anika:** In priority order: 1) Slack integration or a firm date for it, 2) confirmation on SOC 2 and data handling for my CISO, 3) some kind of annual discount because I'll need to justify the switch cost to my director. We'd be migrating 15 people off a tool they already know. There's a productivity cost to that so the new tool has to be clearly better.

**James:** Makes sense.

**Anika:** Oh also — is there a way to do product roadmap views? Not just sprint boards but like a higher-level quarterly roadmap? I use Monday for that right now and it's one of the few things it actually does well.

**[10:00]** She asked about our mobile app briefly. Said hers is slow. I noted it.

**Anika:** "Look, I want to like NovaByte. The core product is better than Monday for actual day-to-day project management. But the ecosystem around it — integrations, compliance docs, roadmap-level views — needs to catch up. You're competing with tools that have had 5 more years to build that stuff out."

**James:** That's fair and really helpful feedback.

**Anika:** Happy to help. Just get me that Slack timeline and I'll take it to my team.

**[11:15]** End.

**Post-interview notes:**
- Solid mid-market prospect, 15 seats, has budget
- Monday.com is the direct comparison — NovaByte wins on UX, loses on integrations
- BLOCKER: Slack integration — she's asked for a date, need to get her one
- Workflow templates landed well — regulated development template is a differentiator
- Compliance needs: SOC 2, data residency, audit trail depth
- Wants roadmap/portfolio view (not just sprint-level)
- Pricing is comparable to Monday ($270 vs $300/mo) so not a barrier
- Annual discount would help justify switch to director
- Mobile app performance flagged as slow
- Timeline: trial expires in 6 days, needs Slack answer before then
- Follow up: Slack integration ETA, SOC 2 documentation, annual pricing options
