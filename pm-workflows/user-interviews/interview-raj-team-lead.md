**[0:00]** Raj was on time, energetic, clearly a fan. Had NovaByte open on his screen already when the call started.

**James:** Raj, you've been one of our most active trial users. How's it been?

**Raj:** Dude. It's been amazing. Like, I'm not even exaggerating. We moved our entire sprint off of Asana in like day 3 and haven't looked back. My team is actually updating their tasks now which NEVER happened in Asana.

**[0:45]** [He's genuinely enthusiastic. Not performing it.]

**James:** What's driving the team adoption?

**Raj:** A few things. The UI is just... it's fast. Asana got so slow. Like you'd click something and wait 2-3 seconds. NovaByte is instant. And the keyboard shortcuts — my devs are all keyboard people and they love it. Also the GitHub integration. We do like 30 PRs a day and having them link to tasks automatically is [chef's kiss].

**Raj:** But honestly? "The analytics dashboard is the reason I'm going to fight for the budget. I can see exactly where our sprints are going sideways and why. Last week I caught a bottleneck in code review because the dashboard showed tasks piling up in the review column. That's worth the subscription right there."

**[2:30]** He shared his screen to show me the analytics. He's built custom dashboards — velocity tracking, cycle time by task type, team workload distribution.

**Raj:** I showed these dashboards to my VP and she was like "how do we not have this already." So that was a nice moment.

**James:** So are you looking to convert to paid?

**Raj:** Yes. 100%. But — here's where it gets annoying. So your pricing is $18/seat/month right? I've got 14 people and probably want to add another 6-8 from the QA team. So let's say 22 people. That's $396/month, roughly $4,700/year.

**[3:45]** He paused here.

**Raj:** So I went to look at annual billing because that should be cheaper right? And I found this promo code — NOVALAUNCH30 — from some blog post. Put it in and it said expired. Which, fine, but then there's no annual discount showing anywhere? Like is there annual billing?

**James:** We do have annual billing, it's—

**Raj:** Because $4,700 is doable but if there's a way to bring it down my finance team will be happier. They just approved a Datadog bill last month so they're kind of in a "do we really need another tool" mood.

**[5:00]** [Pricing friction again but not a dealbreaker for him — more about making the internal sell easier]

**Raj:** "If you can get me to like $15/seat on annual I'll have the PO by Friday. I'm not kidding."

**James:** Let me check what we can do on that. How has the team found the learning curve?

**Raj:** Surprisingly easy. Like I spent maybe an hour setting things up and then just sent everyone a Loom video. Most people were productive in NovaByte within a day. The only complaint I've heard is — and I know everyone says this — no Slack integration. We do standup async in Slack and it'd be nice to push NovaByte updates there.

**[6:30]** [Slack integration is becoming a pattern across interviews. Need to flag for product.]

**Raj:** Oh also there was a weird bug — when I tried to bulk-edit tasks, like selecting 20 tasks and changing the sprint, it kind of froze for a few seconds. Not a crash but it was janky. Happened twice.

**James:** Good to know, I'll flag that for engineering.

**Raj:** And one more thing. Custom fields. We have this "Revenue Impact" field we use on tasks and I couldn't find a way to add custom fields to the task view. Is that a thing?

**James:** It's in our—

**Raj:** "On the roadmap?" [grins] Yeah I figured. That's OK. As long as it's coming.

**[8:00]** He talked about his comparison process briefly.

**Raj:** We looked at Linear too actually. It's clean but too developer-only. Our PMs and designers need to be in the tool too and Linear felt like it was built only for engineers. NovaByte hits this middle ground that works for everyone.

**James:** What about Monday.com or ClickUp?

**Raj:** Monday is too enterprise-y and expensive. ClickUp is... I mean it's ClickUp. [laughs] We tried it last year and it was buggy as hell. Half my team revolted. So no.

**[9:30]** Asked him about anything else.

**Raj:** Honestly just get me a good price on annual billing and we're in. I've already written the justification doc for my VP. "I wrote a 2-page business case for NovaByte at 11pm last Tuesday. That should tell you how much I want this to work."

**James:** That's dedication.

**Raj:** My team is productive in this tool. That's all I need to know.

**[10:15]** End.

**Post-interview notes:**
- VERY high intent to convert, just needs pricing to work out
- Daily active user, has driven organic adoption with 14 team members
- Analytics dashboard is his #1 value prop — quote is great for marketing
- Wants annual billing discount, tried an old promo code (NOVALAUNCH30)
- $15/seat annual would close the deal — need to check with rev team
- Slack integration gap flagged again
- Custom fields requested — another common ask
- Bug report: bulk edit freezing on 20+ tasks
- Linear comparison: too dev-centric. Asana comparison: too slow. ClickUp: too buggy.
- Get him a price by EOW or we risk losing momentum before trial expires day 14
