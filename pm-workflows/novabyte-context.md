# NovaByte — Company Context Document

_Last updated: February 2026_

---

## Company Overview

**NovaByte** is a B2B SaaS project management platform designed for modern product and engineering teams. Founded in 2021 by Priya Sharma (CEO) and Rohan Kapoor (CTO), the company is headquartered in Bangalore with a distributed team across India and the US.

NovaByte raised a **$12M Series A** in Q3 2024 led by Elevation Capital, with participation from Blume Ventures. The company operates a **product-led growth (PLG)** model with a 14-day free trial as the primary acquisition funnel.

The platform differentiates on three pillars: native AI-powered workflows, deep developer tool integrations (GitHub, GitLab, Jira import), and a lightweight UX that avoids the "bloat problem" of legacy tools.

## Top 3 Strategic Priorities

1. **Double trial conversion rate.** The CEO has made this the #1 company priority. Current 8.2% is below the B2B SaaS benchmark of 12-15% for PLG companies. Board is watching this closely. Target: 16% by end of Q2 2026.

2. **Move upmarket without losing PLG DNA.** Enterprise deals are higher ACV but the company doesn't want to become sales-led. The challenge is supporting Enterprise needs (SSO, compliance, procurement) while keeping the self-serve motion fast.

3. **Build AI differentiation.** The competitive landscape is crowded. NovaByte's bet is that AI-native features (smart task assignment, automated standups, predictive project health) will be the wedge against incumbents. Two AI features shipped in 2025; roadmap has four more planned for 2026.

## Known Problems

- **Onboarding is weak.** No guided setup flow. Users land on an empty dashboard. Time-to-first-value is 47 minutes (industry best practice is under 10). This is the single biggest lever for conversion.
- **Day 1 to Day 3 dropoff is severe.** 40% of trial users never return after their first session. We're losing them before they experience any value.
- **Integration setup is friction-heavy.** Connecting GitHub/Slack requires 6+ steps. Users who DO connect integrations convert at 20%, but only 15% of trial users attempt it.
- **Pricing page confusion.** 34% of trial users never visit the pricing page. Those who do spend an average of 12 seconds — suggesting the page isn't effectively communicating value.
- **Solo user problem.** 60% of trial users never invite a teammate. The product's value proposition is collaborative, but most people evaluate it alone and don't see the magic.
- **Enterprise evaluation gap.** Enterprise prospects want to trial with SSO and advanced permissions, which aren't available in the trial. This causes a handoff to Sales that adds 2-3 weeks to the evaluation cycle.

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Positioning | NovaByte Advantage | NovaByte Disadvantage |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Asana** | Enterprise work management | Lighter UX, better pricing, AI-native | Brand recognition, enterprise features, ecosystem |
| **Linear** | Dev-focused project tracking | Broader use case, better for cross-functional teams | Linear has cult-like developer loyalty, faster UX |
| **Monday.com** | Flexible work OS | Less bloated, more opinionated (faster to value) | Monday has massive market presence, more integrations |
| **ClickUp** | All-in-one productivity | Cleaner UX, less overwhelming feature set | ClickUp has broader feature coverage, larger user base |
| **Jira** | Engineering project management | Modern UX, faster setup, AI features | Jira is deeply entrenched, Atlassian ecosystem lock-in |

**Key Insight:** NovaByte wins on speed-to-value and modern UX against incumbents, and on breadth/flexibility against focused tools like Linear. The risk is being stuck in the middle — not specialized enough for developers, not broad enough for enterprise. The AI-native bet is intended to break out of this positioning trap.
