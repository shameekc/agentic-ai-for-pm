## 1. Problem Statement

_Describe the problem we are solving. Who has this problem? How do we know it exists? Include data or user research that validates the problem. Be specific — avoid vague statements like "users are frustrated."_

[Write here]

---

## 2. Target Users & Personas

_Define the primary and secondary users for this feature. Include relevant characteristics: role, company size, technical sophistication, goals, pain points. If you have existing personas, reference them. If not, describe the target user in enough detail that engineering and design can empathize with them._

**Primary User:**
[Write here]

**Secondary User(s):**
[Write here]

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics

_What does success look like? Define 2-4 measurable outcomes tied to business or user value. Include baseline numbers where available and target numbers with a timeframe._

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Timeframe |
|--------|----------|--------|-----------|
| [Metric 1] | [Current value] | [Target value] | [By when] |
| [Metric 2] | [Current value] | [Target value] | [By when] |

---

## 4. Non-Goals (What We're NOT Doing)

_Explicitly state what is out of scope. This is just as important as defining what's in scope. It prevents scope creep and aligns the team on boundaries. Be specific about what might seem like a natural extension but is deliberately excluded from this effort._

- [Non-goal 1 and why it's excluded]
- [Non-goal 2 and why it's excluded]
- [Non-goal 3 and why it's excluded]

---

## 5. Solution Overview

_Describe the proposed solution at a high level. How does it work from the user's perspective? What is the core experience? Include a narrative or walkthrough if helpful. Avoid jumping into technical details — focus on the "what" and "why" before the "how."_

[Write here]

---

## 6. User Stories

_Write user stories in the format: "As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]." Prioritize them (P0 = must-have for launch, P1 = important but can follow, P2 = nice-to-have). Include acceptance criteria for P0 stories._

**P0 — Must Have:**
- As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit].
  - _Acceptance Criteria:_ [Define what "done" looks like]

**P1 — Important:**
- As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit].

**P2 — Nice to Have:**
- As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit].

**Performance Requirements:**
[Write here]

**Constraints:**

## 8. Data Requirements

_What data do we need to build, train, or operate this feature? What data will this feature generate? Include requirements for analytics instrumentation, data pipelines, privacy considerations, and any ML/AI data needs._

**Data Inputs:**
[Write here]

**Data Outputs / Instrumentation:**
[Write here]

**Privacy & Compliance:**
[Write here]

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

_Identify the top risks to this initiative — technical, business, user experience, regulatory, or otherwise. For each risk, describe the potential impact and your mitigation strategy._

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [Strategy] |
| [Risk 2] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [Strategy] |

---

## 10. Human-in-the-Loop Strategy

_If this feature involves AI/ML or automation, describe where and how humans stay in control. Define escalation paths, override mechanisms, review processes, and feedback loops. How do we ensure the system fails gracefully?_

**Human Oversight Points:**
[Write here]

**Escalation Paths:**
[Write here]

**Feedback Mechanisms:**
[Write here]

---

## 11. Rollout Plan

_How will we ship this? Define the phases, rollout percentages, success criteria for each phase, and rollback plan. Include any feature flag strategy._

| Phase | Description | Audience | Success Criteria | Duration |
|-------|------------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| Phase 1 | [Description] | [Who sees it] | [How we measure] | [How long] |
| Phase 2 | [Description] | [Who sees it] | [How we measure] | [How long] |

**Rollback Plan:**
[Write here]

## 12. Open Questions

_List unresolved questions that need answers before or during development. Assign an owner and target date for each._

| # | Question | Owner | Target Date | Resolution |
|---|----------|-------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | [Question] | [Who] | [When] | [Pending/Resolved] |
| 2 | [Question] | [Who] | [When] | [Pending/Resolved] |
